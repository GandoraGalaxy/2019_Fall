Use the `create-react-app` by Facebook to get started.

This assignment takes the basic concepts of components, props and state to build a simple `To-Do` app.  Users should be able to enter input and have that be committed to state.  The app should also allow editing, removing and completing of todo's.  

Feel free to reach out in the discord channel for help.
